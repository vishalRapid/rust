# By default variables are immutable (which means they are not updatable), so we need to declare variable with mut keyword
    e.g -> let mut name = "Vishal";

# While we are converting a string to number, we need to do two things:
    - we need to trim the string first in order to remove space and new line
    - We need to parse the string to number
